1 - Undergraduate Research Program (URP), KAIST 2024 Summer/Fall

Project Title: **Fabrication of Chiral Nanowires by Using Protein Nanotubes**
Award: **3rd Prize (Encouragement Award)** among all **2024 Summer/Fall & Long-Term URP** submissions
	â€¢	Selected to receive a competitive KAIST Undergraduate Research Program (URP) grant to conduct independent research on fabricating chiral nanowires using protein nanotube scaffolds.
	â€¢	Conducted extensive literature review, designed the experimental pipeline, and performed all laboratory experiments.
	â€¢	Gained hands-on experience with advanced instrumentation, including Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM); obtained licensing and operational training.
	â€¢	Refined wet lab skills and applied quantitative analysis to validate structural and morphological outcomes.
	â€¢	Submitted a final written report and compiled a detailed research notebook, followed by an oral presentation and poster showcase at the Bio and Brain Engineering Open Lab Night 2025 in Daejeon, South Korea.

After the official report submission, I continued refining the project, obtained further results, and presented these updated findings during the URP Final Presentation Session.

This research explored tubulin-based protein scaffolds as templates for constructing chiral nanostructuresâ€”structures with promising applications in nanoscale electronics and photonic systems.
